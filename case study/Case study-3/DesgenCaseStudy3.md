**How is this website different ?**

Unlike other websites, Desgen provides some of the wonderful features that no other designing website gives.

**Events/ courses**

- Here, the organisers can post about the various scholarships and competitions they are conducting and online registrations links can be shared.


**Art store**

- This will include other stuff like where to buy designing related art stuff like pencils, tablets and software tools.
- All the purchases will take place from our site only and we will provide payment gateways as per the option selected by the customer. 






**WeeklyTrend**

- This will be the place where the users can see the most loved and looked designs of the week and also can get some new ideas over broadening their insights related to their imagination.
- Along with that, newly released designs of the week will also be available on the site.


**Community Feed**

- If a user wants some ideas in a design he is working on then he can post the ideas, just like a post on instagram and the other viewers can view it and can comment on their ideas that can help him and if they would like to collaborate in helping the user.
- For this feature we can also provide the users with a chat option in their profiles, where they can search the users and discuss the ideas.


















Research 

**User Flowchart** 

We had a rough idea of how the website would function. Mapping the website's basic flow forced us to think about each step of the user's journey through the solution. I drew it out on paper first, then digitally made it.




**Sketches or Wireframes** 










**Visual Research** 

**Inspiration Board**

I make an inspiration board before I start working on the visual design. The aim was to gain knowledge of the visual environment while also getting inspiration from other design websites.

Color Palette



**Typography**

Inter features a tall x-height to aid in readability of mixed-case and lower-case text. Several OpenType features are provided as well, like contextual alternates that adjusts punctuation depending on the shape of surrounding glyphs.






**Icons & Illustrations**

The graphics and symbols play a significant role in the overall design. They reflect ideas and concepts that in some cases cannot be conveyed through words. Moreover, they allow for visual clarity, which aids in the development of user confidence and creates moments of delight.







Final Design



Conclusion

Designing the website has been a challenging and rewarding journey. 

From the mere beginning, we had gone through various design websites and 

found faults and features that weren't present in those websites but were needed for suitability of user.

It was clear from the onset that the major challenge would be website layout and discussions over it on how we would enhance it, making them more accessible to people.

We understood the needs of the users through examinations and conversation with different people. Finally, after all the discussions and rigorous work, we made a website layout that we thought was the most user enhanced website according to the personalized needs of the community.
